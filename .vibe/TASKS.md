BUGS:

The chat input card needs to lock out the 'send' button when something is being sent. Likewise we should line up the general ux experience of all the cards. I like the size of the drawing card we are taking we should follow the same pattern with the others. Likwise, when we are swiping amongst the different input types, they should default to their 'icon-only' landing state, when selected, then the interface can be shown. This should follow for all of the input types. 
For the drawing one, we should default to a full-screen modal, so the user can draw on the whole of their screen, with a button to "de-expand", and then the interface should allow them to send. 
Ask for help if you need it, break down the tasks if its helpful.
