BUGS:

Each card that has a settings section should also allow for the settings to be "closed". This is especially true for the agent cards. The agent cars should show the name of their agent (e.g. OpenAI). The intput and output cards should do the same. 

Each input card should be able to trigger a "send" on their own, we should remove the additional input/send buttons beneath our carousel of input types, it is confusing. Since each input can initiate their own 'send' process, it will be much cleaner. We will need to put a "send" in our text input card.
